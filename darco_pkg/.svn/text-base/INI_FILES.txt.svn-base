Initialization files for darco:

protocol.ini: determines the external input to the network. On each line the stimulation to one pool is set.

		 First column: duration of the stimulation in ms; durations equal to 0 be considered equal
		 to the first non-zero duration. This means that for stimulating more then one pool at the
		 same time you have to put 0 duration to the first ones and the desired duration to the last.

		 Second column: the pool that will be stimulated. Pools are usually numbered as follows:
		 0: inhibitory, 1 to N: selective pools, N+1: non-selective pool.

		 Third column: stimulation intensity in Hz (this is considered to be the firing rate of
		 external neurons projecting to the network). In the resting state this value is usually taken
		 to be 3 Hz (from 800 neurons).

connectivity.ini: strength of connection between pools. Conductancies are defined in the code. 

neurons.ini: biophysical parameters of neurons

pfc.ini: defines the architecture of the network.
	First col: pool ID
	Second col: numeber of neurons
	Third col: excitatory flag (1 if the pool is excitatory, 0 otherwise)
